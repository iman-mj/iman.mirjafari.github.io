		<h1>Iman Mirjafari</h1>
		<p>I completed my undergraduate studies at Isfahan University of Technology,
		specializing in statistics, and achieving the esteemed third rank among my 
		fellow scholars. The realm of numbers and mathematics captivated me from an 
		early age, fostering a deep passion that flourished throughout my educational
		journey, particularly during my high school years when I ventured into the realm 
		of programming and composed my inaugural creation in the elegant language of Pascal.
		Guided by a profound appreciation for the interconnectedness of statistics, computer
		science, and mathematics, I made a deliberate choice to pursue this path at the university
		level. Diligently undertaking a comprehensive array of courses, I embarked upon an intellectual
		pilgrimage into the ethereal domains of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
		Driven by an unyielding thirst for knowledge, I consistently ranked among the top students
		, with a particular ardor for the enigmatic wonders of mathematics. Fuelled by an unwavering
		commitment to intellectual inquiry, I find solace in the pursuit of research, diligently
		illuminating unexplored avenues. </p>
